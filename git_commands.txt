// AS far as I have understood, the RSA key buisness is for authenticating logging in into github/any git website.
// Can be understood as instead of a window popping up asking username and password, you create an RSA key and LINK it with your account.
// This ensures that only the person creating the can access his/her github account (on cloud) and store it into settings.
// Once this link is established, it is as if login successful and you can do whatsoever you want.
//  Therefore any person having the SSH local file in his/her PC and knowing the password (bare minimum and sufficient) has as much privelages as the owner.
// (given that owner has linked his/her public key to his/her account)!
